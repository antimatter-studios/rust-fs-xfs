#
#   vm.sh up            boot the VM (idempotent; provisions on first run)
#   vm.sh run <cmd...>  run a command inside the VM
#   vm.sh share         print the host path of the shared directory
#   vm.sh put <file>    copy a file into the shared directory, echo guest path
#   vm.sh down          halt the VM (state is kept; next `up` is fast)
#   vm.sh destroy       delete the VM entirely
#
# The VM is the real-Linux oracle: mkfs.xfs, the in-kernel XFS driver and
# xfs_repair are Linux-only, and validating this driver against anything
# less than a real kernel would just be marking our own homework.
#
# The VM is kept running between invocations on purpose. Booting is the
# slow part; an iterate-and-check loop should pay it once.
