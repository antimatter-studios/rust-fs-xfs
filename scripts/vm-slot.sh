#   vm-slot.sh status      say who holds it and for how long
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. These VMs are not small: this one asks for 4 GB and
# the NTFS Windows box asks for 8. Two of them plus a `cargo test` fills
# a laptop, and when it fills, the machine does not fail cleanly -- it
# starts killing background work. That is exactly what happened on the
# night several agents were building fixtures in parallel: two VMs left
# running for hours, and unrelated jobs killed for want of memory with
# no message that connected the two.
#
# So the slot is deliberately a single global one rather than one per
# repository. The cost is real and worth stating: fixture builds in
# different repositories no longer overlap, and a queued build waits for
# the one ahead of it. That is slower on a good day and much better on a
# bad one, because the failure it removes was silent and the cost it
# adds is visible.
#
# The state lives outside every repository, because the whole point is
# that repositories do not know about each other.

# the lock it examined can be gone and a different, live lock can occupy
# that path. Two waiters agreeing about one stale holder is enough: the
# first breaks and acquires, the second's `rm -rf` deletes the FIRST's
# lock, and both run a VM. That is the failure this file exists to
# prevent, produced by the file itself.
#
# THE MOVE COMES FIRST AND THE QUESTION AFTER. `mv` within one directory
# is atomic, so from the moment it returns the live path is free and
# nobody can be acquiring the thing being examined. Then the moved
# copy's token is compared against the one the caller was authorised
# with, and a mismatch puts it back rather than deleting it. Checking
# before the move leaves exactly the window the token exists to close.
# Delete the lock if it still holds the generation named, and otherwise
# leave it exactly as found. 0 when it was deleted, 1 when it was not.
#
# ONE IMPLEMENTATION FOR BOTH CALLERS, because a break and a release are
# the same operation seen from two sides, and the release path is the
# one that runs constantly -- `vm.sh down` calls it whether or not this
# repository ever booted anything. Having it take the token as an
# argument is also what makes it testable: the window is microseconds
# wide in a process that then exits, so a test cannot reach it through
# the CLI, but it can hold one generation's token and present it after
# the lock underneath has been replaced.

    # generation that replaced the one it inspected.
