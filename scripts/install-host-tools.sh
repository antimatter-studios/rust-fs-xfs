# install-host-tools.sh — install what the oracle VM needs on this machine.
#
# Everything this project runs happens inside the VM. Four things cannot,
# because they are what starts the VM in the first place: a hypervisor, a
# filesystem-sharing daemon, and the two Vagrant plugins that drive them.
#
# They were previously a comment in the Vagrantfile, which meant a new
# machine found out what was missing by hitting an error. This script is
# the repository saying what it needs, so the answer travels with the
# code rather than living in whoever set it up last.
#
#   ./scripts/install-host-tools.sh          install anything missing
#   ./scripts/install-host-tools.sh --check  report only, change nothing
#   ./scripts/install-host-tools.sh --quiet  as --check, silent when all present
#
# `--quiet` is what `vm.sh` calls before booting, so a missing tool is
# reported with the command that fixes it rather than as a failure to
# start. It says nothing when there is nothing to say: the check runs
# before every `vm.sh run`, and a reassurance printed a hundred times a
# test run is just noise to scroll past.
