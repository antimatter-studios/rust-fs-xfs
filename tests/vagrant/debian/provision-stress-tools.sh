# provision-stress-tools.sh — put `fsstress` and `fsx` in the guest.
#
# These two come from the filesystem test suite (fstests, formerly
# xfstests). `fsstress` runs long randomised sequences of filesystem
# operations; `fsx` hammers one file with randomised reads, writes,
# truncates, hole punches and mmap operations. Both reach on-disk states
# that a hand-written fixture never will, which is the whole reason they
# are here: scripts/vm-build-stress-fixtures.sh uses them to *generate*
# filesystems, and the kernel plus the reference checker remain the
# oracles.
#
# The suite itself is never run against this driver — it tests a mounted
# filesystem through the kernel's VFS, and this driver is a userspace
# library. Only the two generators are wanted.
#
# LICENSING. fstests is GPL-2.0. It is cloned, built and executed
# **inside the guest only**. Its source and its build artefacts never
# enter this repository, nothing from it is copied, quoted or adapted
# here, and the binaries are invoked as external programs. Running a
# program does not make the caller a derivative work of it; vendoring its
# code would. Keep it that way: if a helper is needed, write one.
#
# Debian bookworm has no package for either binary (`apt-cache search
# xfstests` and `... fsstress` both come back empty, and there is no
# `ltp` package), so building from source in the guest is the only
# option. The build is pinned to a release tag so a rebuilt VM gets the
# same generators rather than whatever upstream looks like that day.
