# vm-slot-break-generation.sh — a break deletes what it inspected.
#
# `break_lock` and `cmd_release` both used to be `rm -rf "$LOCK"` on a
# FIXED path. Between deciding a holder is stale — a decision that reads
# the record, runs a `ps`, and sometimes sleeps a second — and the `rm`
# executing, the examined lock can be gone and a different, live lock
# can occupy that path. Two waiters agreeing about one stale holder is
# enough: the first breaks and acquires, the second's `rm -rf` deletes
# the first's lock, and both boot a VM. That is the failure the slot
# exists to prevent, produced by the slot itself.
#
# THE WINDOW CANNOT BE REACHED THROUGH THE CLI. It is microseconds wide
# in a process that then exits, so these tests source the script with
# `AM_VM_SLOT_LIB=1` and call the real functions, holding one
# generation's token while the lock underneath is replaced. Testing a
# reimplementation would prove nothing about the file that ships.

# --- the token cmd_acquire writes -------------------------------------

# EVERYTHING BELOW COMPARES TOKENS. NOTHING BELOW PRODUCES ONE.
#
# `set_lock` takes the token as an argument, so every test in this file
# hands itself `gen-A`, `gen-B`, `gen-live` and then checks that
# `break_lock` and `delete_generation` compare them correctly. The
# expression that actually makes a generation identifiable is never
# executed by any of them, and a comparison is only worth as much as the
# thing it compares.
#
# So a plausible simplification defeats the whole file. Replacing
#
#     "$(now)-$$-${RANDOM}"    with    "$(now)"
#
# leaves every other check here at EXIT=0 while two acquisitions in the
# same second get the SAME token — at which point a breaker that read
# the first passes its check against the second and deletes a live
# replacement's lock. That is the production failure this slot exists to
# prevent, measured elsewhere as two VMs 5401 seconds apart under a
# 5400s limit.
#
# `cmd_acquire` on a free path is `mkdir` then `printf` and returns; it
# boots nothing, so it can be called here directly. The two acquisitions
# below land in the same second and the same process, which is the case
# that matters: it is the part of the token that is neither the clock
# nor the pid that has to carry the difference.
#
# IF THIS EVER FAILS, IT IS NOT FLAKY. `$RANDOM` is 0..32767, so two
# draws repeat with probability 1/32768, and a failure here says two
# generations really were given the same identity — which is the defect,
# rarely, rather than a false alarm.
