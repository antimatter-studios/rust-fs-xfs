//! `chore_min_version` must cover the keys `chores.yml` actually uses.
//!
//! # The failure this exists to stop
//!
//! `chore_min_version` is enforced as a floor on the running binary,
//! and chore's YAML decoder uses `KnownFields(true)` -- an unknown key
//! is a hard parse error, not a field it ignores. So a declared floor
//! that is LOWER than the keys in the file produces the worst of both:
//! a binary between the declared floor and the real one passes the
//! version check, then fails to load the file at all with a generic
//! `unknown field "timeout" in a Task`, which never mentions
//! `chore_min_version` and sends the reader looking at their YAML
//! instead of at their chore build.
//!
//! `timeout:` and `on_timeout:` were adopted here while the floor still
//! said `0.6.0`, and the identical drift happened in a sibling
//! repository in the same week. It is not the kind of mistake that gets
//! noticed by the person who makes it, because their own chore is new
//! enough.
//!
//! # This parses the file rather than scanning it
//!
//! The key check used to be `line.starts_with("timeout:")` over the
//! file's text, and that is the shape it was returned for. Two
//! ordinary spellings defeat it SILENTLY -- the guard stays green
//! while the floor is wrong:
//!
//! ```text
//! floor 0.9.0, keys left plain            EXIT=101   <- the control
//! floor 0.9.0, "timeout:" / "on_timeout:" EXIT=0     <- DEFEAT
//! floor 0.9.0, net: { timeout: 45m }      EXIT=0     <- DEFEAT
//! ```
//!
//! A quoted key is the same key; a flow mapping puts it on a line that
//! starts with something else. Parsed, neither is an edge case: the
//! quoting is resolved before this file sees anything, and a mapping
//! is a mapping wherever it is written.
//!
//! THE FLOOR LOOKUP WAS NOT THE SAME RISK, and lumping the two together
//! would misdescribe both. It was the same raw-scan shape, but a quoted
//! floor is simply not FOUND, `violations` then reports "declares no
//! chore_min_version at all", and the test goes red. It failed closed.
//! It is parsed here too, because the document is already parsed and
//! two techniques in one file is how the next defect arrives -- not
//! because it was dangerous.
//!
//! # What this guard does NOT do
//!
//! It is not a model of chore's schema and cannot be: nothing available
//! here knows which release introduced a given key. It is a table of
//! the keys THIS repository uses whose introducing version is known,
//! and a row is added when a newer key is adopted. So it catches the
//! mistake that has already been made twice rather than every mistake
//! of the shape. A guard that under-claims and says so is worth more
//! than one that implies coverage it has not got.
